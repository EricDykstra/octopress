Thankfully, the fad of smashing all possible information "above the fold" has been on a steady decline. People [don't mind scrolling](http://uxmyths.com/post/654047943/myth-people-dont-scroll), and although, obviously, the first thing someone sees on a website is important, the term "above the fold" seemed to get stuck in the heads of a lot of people. If you've designed websites for clients for any length of time, there's a good chance one of them has said this phrase to you with concern about your design.

There are an increasing number of sites using long-form pages in their designs, usually on their homepage, and many use it in a very effective way. These kinds of pages are an incredibly effective way to tell a story. Like the analogue of an actual scroll, or flipping through pages, scrolling down a web page is a very natural way to progress through a series of text and/or imagery. However, as with any design trend, the original purpose sometimes gets overlooked, and the style is applied in places that it doesn't make sense.

There are a couple of different ways that long-form websites can be effective. The most common is used to drive a call to action, another way is just to explain some sort of idea through a narrative without any express call to action. For the first case, generally the page gives a call to action right away for those that are already sold on the idea, and then gives more detail and reasons to perform the call to action as the user scrolls down the page.

Following is a few sites that use long-form design. I tried to get a variety of good and bad, big and small companies, with different designs.

###[[Diablo 3 game page](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/d3/)
The goal of this page is to get the viewer to download and play the demo through the call to action button: "Play Free Now". Underneath, it gives the option to buy the game for those who came to this page for that express purpose.

As you scroll down the page, you get videos and screenshots (far easier to get someone to check out than a heavy game demo), specifics on heroes, and then more specifics on gameplay, and finally links to more information. This follows a pretty logical pattern, and I think long-form design in this manner is a good way to sell Diablo 3. It captures the atmosphere of the game while being readable and easy to follow.

###[Simple homepage](https://www.simple.com/)
A long form, story-style page is an effective way to explain a unique or innovative product or service that people aren't familiar with. The Simple site does a very good job of explaining their service, why they're different, and the features that they have and are coming out with. Someone with no familiarity with Simple can go to that page, find out what they're about, and decide if it's right for them.

"Get Ready to Leave Your Bank". If I don't want to leave my bank, I'll leave the site. If I do have problems with my bank, it's a convincing line to get me to read what they have to offer. Once I'm captured by that hook, I scroll down and get a sense what they're about as a company. This is a great example of storytelling with a long form design because they capture the correct audience, and sell them through a convincing story.

###[[Airbnb Jobs page](https://www.airbnb.com/jobs)
This is a poor use of long-form design. I have to imagine if you're going specifically to the Airbnb jobs page you're already interested in getting a job there. But the jobs section is just a list of jobs with no description past the title, and there's not even a quick way to get there aside from scrolling to the bottom of the page or clicking through their presentation.. I don't think it really gives any sense of the culture or what working at Airbnb is like. We get a little at the very end of the page in "Common Questions", but I doubt many people get that far if they click one of the job postings higher up on the page. To me, this seems like a page centered around the design rather than the content.

###[[New eBay Logo Announcement](http://pages.ebay.com/announcements/new/index.html)
Here is our first example without any call to action. This is purely a story to convey information for a brand. Although the background is a little bit distracting, it follows a good form. First, showing the logo, by itself, with no distractions. After that, a letter from the president, and following that even more information. I like the use of a long-form page for this kind of information because it acts as a press release, but is done in a creative way that shows of the personality of the new brand.

###[[Grouper homepage](https://www.joingrouper.com/)
Grouper is a startup company, and most people going to the site likely don't know what it's all about; it's certainly not an established brand. We start at the top with a quick, concise explanation and a call to action, follow that with some testimonial quotes that explain the atmosphere of the brand, and then end the page with a slightly longer explanation and a list of available cities. I think it would be useful if there was another "join" button at the bottom of the site, as well as maybe a paragraph of information somewhere on the page, but overall this is an effective use of long-form design. The design itself has a lot of personality and is overall fantastic.

And that's all. I hope these examples give you a better idea of when long-form pages can be effective, and also that it's not a design trend that can be smashed into any use case. Let me know if you've seen any other great uses of this design (or even terrible ones!), and what you think of the article in the comments below.
